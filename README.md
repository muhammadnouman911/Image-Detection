# üöÄ Image-Detection: Unleashing the Power of AI for Object Recognition

Welcome to the **Image-Detection** repository! This project demonstrates how to harness the power of deep learning for image detection using the state-of-the-art **YOLOv5** model. Whether you want to identify cats, dogs, or other objects, this repository provides the tools to get started with object detection.

## üìÇ What's Inside?

This repository contains everything you need to kickstart your own image detection journey:

- **yolov5/**: The heart of the project ‚Äì YOLOv5 model for real-time object detection.
- **README.md**: This file, where you'll find all the details to get started.
- **cat_dog_detection.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that shows how to detect cats and dogs in images using YOLOv5.
- **image_detection.ipynb**: A more general approach to image detection, applying YOLOv5 on various objects.

## üõ† Requirements

To get this project up and running, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5 dependencies
- OpenCV
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Pillow (PIL)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadmadnouman911/Image-Detection.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Once the repo is cloned, navigate to the project folder and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Notebooks

- **`cat_dog_detection.ipynb`**: Start by running this notebook, where you‚Äôll learn how to detect **cats** and **dogs** in your images with YOLOv5.
  
- **`image_detection.ipynb`**: Explore more general image detection techniques with YOLOv5 in this notebook. Test on various images and objects.

## üí° How to Use

1. **Detect Cats & Dogs:**  
   Open `cat_dog_detection.ipynb` to run a demo where you can upload images to detect cats and dogs. Just drag and drop your image and see the magic unfold!

2. **General Image Detection:**  
   Try out `image_detection.ipynb` for a more flexible approach to object detection. You can modify the code to detect different objects in any image!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Detection:**  
  YOLOv5 processes images quickly and accurately, making it ideal for real-time object detection applications.
  
- **Easy to Use:**  
  The Jupyter Notebooks make it easy to get started with minimal setup. Just clone the repo, install dependencies, and you‚Äôre ready to go!

- **Highly Customizable:**  
  YOLOv5 can be fine-tuned and customized for different use cases beyond just cats and dogs.
